# Evaluating and Improving Defenses with MITRE ATT&CK

This repository contains the ATT&CK Navigator matrices for the threats discussed in [Breakout BRKSEC-2227 "Evaluating and Improving Defenses with MITRE ATT&CK"](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/learn/session-catalog.html?search=BRKSEC-2227). This session is being delivered at Cisco Live US in San Diego June 11th, 2025.

It includes a top-level JSON that will pre-populate all of the component JSONs in 1 action. This will also include more source JSONs and the example YAML files for DeTTECT.
